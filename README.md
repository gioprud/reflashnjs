## About Reflash
Reflash is a web application hosted by vercel made as a solution to our capstone project.
The stack was Next.js, MongoDB, React, Express.js
As of now it is non functional due to the database being taken down, however the code remains as a portfolio to what we could learn to accomplish within a limited timeframe.
