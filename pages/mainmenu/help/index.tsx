            A set of flashcard can be viewed by either viewing previous sets or creating a new one.

            By clicking on the View Sets button, the user is shown existing sets or is given the option to create a new one.

            Once a set is opened the user has access to the flashcards.

            When using flashcards, the quesiton will be on the front of the card.

            Once the question has been read the user can then click the flip button to reveal the answer.

            If the user answered the correct answer they can click the Correct button which lets Reflash know that the user knows that question.

            If the user answered the incorrect answer they can click the Incorrect button which lets Reflash know that the user doesn't know the question.

            If the user answered the correct answer, the flashcard will be marked as correct.

            If the user answered the incorrect answer, the flashcard will be marked as incorrect and will be shown again until the user answeres correctly.

            After this a new flashcard will be shown and the process is repeated until every flashcard is answered correctly.</div>
